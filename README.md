# Vaporizer

Open source Vaporizer KiCad schematics (requires DIY PCB layout, would love it if someone contributed a laid out PCB but there's no expectation of that here!)

Built using AI: one thing you might want to note is the 4mm traces for the HighCurrent netclass: such wide traces can probably be avoided if you design the traces with the volume of the trace in mind (printing 2oz copper will help) and will need to be avoided (necked) when connecting to IC pins due to limited clearance. Currently designed for a peak coil current of 5.0A.
